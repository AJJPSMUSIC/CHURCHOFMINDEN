    <h2>
      The Church of Minden is a new concept in religion that can co-exist with Minden followers religious beliefs. 
	    Minden is based on a singularity mindset and the belief in a single, all-powerful deity that manifests to us daily in every shape, form, object or emotion each of us can and will percieve differently. 
	    Our philosophy promotes healthy, non-toxic eating and exercising habits, and encourages the pursuit of natural sources of joy and elation. 
	    We believe in treating children with respect and kindness, away from adult sexuality to allow them to grow up at their own pace respecfully. 
	    Minden allows adults to express their sexuality freely but focuses on a healthy body, balaced mind and personal synchronicity.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      At the heart of our beliefs is the concept of "Minden", it means "Everything" in ancient Hungarian.
	    Minden is a powerful energy that binds the universe together and can be harnessed for good or for evil. 
	    We do not adhere to any specific doctrine or dogma, and welcome individuals of all backgrounds and beliefs to join us in exploring the mysteries of MINDEN and the nature of the divine.
