          The Church of Minden is faith that can co-exist with other religious beliefs. Minden is a singularity mindset and the faith in an all-powerful deity who manifests to us daily in every shape, form, person, object or emotion each of us lives to perceive differently. Our philosophy promotes healthy, non-toxic eating habits, exercise and encourages natural sources of joy and elation. We believe in treating children with respect and kindness, away from adult sexuality to allow them to grow up at their own pace respecfully. Minden encourages adults towards a healthy body, balanced mind and personal wellbeing focused mindset.

At the heart of our beliefs is the concept of "Minden"; this means "Everything" in ancient Hungarian. Minden is a powerful energy that binds the universe together and this can be harnessed for good or for evil. We do not adhere to insidious doctrines and dogmas. We welcome individuals of all backgrounds and beliefs to come forward and get assessed to join us in exploring the mysteries of MINDEN, the nature of the divine and find the answers no one and no thing was able to give you until now.
